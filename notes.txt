Accurate random block generation model greatly improved play.

Remember
non-static reference members cause copy/move operations to be implicitly deleted.
List initializer interpretation
min() vs lowest()

Improved performance
    Using generators
    Not using the heap.

Why not ref(move()) ?
    workers.push_back(thread{
        &get_best_foreseeable_state_from_subtree,
        move(*op_child),
        ref(results),
        ref(results_mutex)
    });


/*
mutex: Exclusive access. Assuming everyone CAN be a writer.
shared_mutex: Non-exclusive access. Differentiates between readers and writers

unique_lock: Lock as a writer. Usable on mutex and shared_mutex.
shared_lock: Lock as a reader only. Usable on shared_mutex.

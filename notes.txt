clock division is probably almost certainly wrong.

another concern is thinking about how the clock works now, start/stop safety, and when we start counting vs when we should start counting

if it stutters, it's probably disk

============


View sticky notes on mac for stutter time stamps.

Normally, according to OpenShot video replay, we go from presented frame to a frame where we have moved in ~30ms.
But occasionally, it takes ~200ms.
    Eyes and brain are not to blame, even though brain took 10ms instead of ~1ms.
Look at sutter.mp4 and stutter_debug.mp4

STUTTER IS due to low hard drive space.


Not a solution, but another thought: Make c++ limit even lower? to 5ms?

System Wide
    Go faster
    hesitation due to poor pruning is terrible for time.

Eyes
    Improve queue framework: 3 things: current stable, last stable, raw frame.
    What was this? - Too slow? Look at replay right after a hold?
    read() from another thread?
    Better star ignoring?

Brain
    Iterative DFS
    With the new pruning, does he play the same game?
    More preemption?
    Time limit appears to not work.

Hands
    Timing instead of poll count?
    4 poll count for down, 2 poll count for neutral.
    dynamically change cycle count


============================================================

Decisions decisions:
    ./main w 123 4 6 100 1
    no differences in play with length=6, auto length = 3, growth thresh=2
    plays same game, but 4.6268420551x less comparisons on average


=====
my gpu could hold 8e9 / 280 state objects. ~ 28.5 million
sizeof(State) = 280

could reduce to 272 --> ~29.4 million
could reduce to 264 --> ~30.3 million


=====
4 deep, pruning: ~94k comparisons per turn
4 deep, no pruning: 1.8e6 comparisons per turn.

Accurate random block generation model greatly improved play.
    +1 tetris percent
    never die

Remember
non-static reference members cause copy/move operations to be implicitly deleted.
List initializer interpretation
numeric limits...
    min() vs lowest()

Improved performance
    Using generators
    Not using the heap.

====

Not ref(move(*op_child)) because the return type of move is already an rvalue reference, more specifically:

remove_reference<T>::type&&

    workers.push_back(thread{
        &get_best_foreseeable_state_from_subtree,
        move(*op_child),
        ref(results),
        ref(results_mutex)
    });

Accurate random block generation model greatly improved play.
    +1 tetris percent
    never die

Remember
non-static reference members cause copy/move operations to be implicitly deleted.
List initializer interpretation
numeric limits...
    min() vs lowest()

Improved performance
    Using generators
    Not using the heap.

====

Not ref(move(*op_child)) because the return type is already a reference, more specifically: remove_reference<T>::type&&
    workers.push_back(thread{
        &get_best_foreseeable_state_from_subtree,
        move(*op_child),
        ref(results),
        ref(results_mutex)
    });
